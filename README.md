# About

Red Packet DApp is an application that allows users to share their ELA publicly and privately. 

# Packet Creators

User has the option to choose between random, fixed, or supernode for their Red Packet.

1. Random - This allows the packet creator to share their ELA in a random amount. For example, if the packet creator adds 10 ELA inside a Red Packet with 10 packets to share, a claimer can win any amount under 10 ELA considering what is left after others claimed their share.
2. Fixed - This option is more direct compared to Random. If a packet creator creates a Fixed Red Packet with 10 ELA and 10 packets, each claimer will win 1 ELA (10 ELA % 10 claims = 1 ELA each)

When a packet type is chosen, a packet creator is required to fill their name, ELA amount and packet amount for their Red Packet. For what is optional, a packet creator can leave a special note for their packet claimers to see. They can also decide who gets to claim the rewards by listing their beneficiaries using their ELA address. 

Once a Red Packet is created, they must send the total ELA displayed to the ELA address given on screen. A link will also be generated for the packet creator to share for others to start claiming. However, claimers to a Red Packet will not be able to receive the ELA they won till ELA from the Red Packet creator is sent and confirmed

# Packet Grabbers
 
To be a packet grabber, one must have possession of a Red Packet link provided by a packet creator. This can be found by the packet creator publicly shared on Social Media or privately through direct message. 

A Red Packet link will look something like this - https://scheme.elastos.org/grabredpacket?packet=12345678910

To simply claim, a packet grabber needs to click on the link which will direct them to the Claim Page inside the Red Packet application. Upon view, the user will be asked for their name and ELA address. Once this information is submitted inside the app, the packet grabber will instantly be notificed if they won a share of the Red Packet or not. If a packet is successfully claimed by the user, the app will show exactly how much they won, as well as information of the Red Packet such as the packet creator's name, special note and list of all claimers thus far. If a user fails to claim, it is either because they have already claimed their share or the Red Packet has exceeded its packet amount.
